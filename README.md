# Vehicle Trajectory Map matching Method Based on Deep Neural Networks
we use a deep neural network-based map matching method to improve the matching accuracy of complex road networks. And since the deep learning model requires a large amount of trajectory data with labels, we propose a GPS trajectory generation
algorithm based on road networks. Two kinds of trajectory sequences are generated at the same time which are GPS trajectory coordinate sequences and the corresponding road IDs where the trajectories are located.The generated trajectories are sampled and noise is added to simulate the features of real trajectories. We investigate and develop a TRANSFORMER-based trajectory map matching algorithm and evaluate to what extent an accurate trajectory can be reconstructed.
